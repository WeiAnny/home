			<h2>Dangers</h2> <!-- description of the mushroom's dangers -->
			<p>Ranked number three for most dangerous mushroom is the deadly webcap! This mushroom
			can poison simply by tasting, and results in kidney failure within weeks, leading to death!
			Even better, there is not yet an identified cure, so the only solution to not dying is 
			a kidney transplant. However, the real danger for this fungi is its high rate of 
			misdiagnosis. Since the symptoms arrive very slowly(unlike most poisonous mushrooms, whose effects
			may appear within a day) and are similar to that of a flu, the deadly webcap&rsquo;s toxins
			are usually left mistreated, allowing them to to kill it&rsquo;s victim!</p>
			<h2>Identification</h2> <!-- description of the mushroom's characteristics -->
			<p>The deadly webcap has a brownish-orange cap and crowded yellow gills(turns brown as spores mature). 
			It has a diameter of about 4cm to 8cm. The surface of the mushroom is described to be rough(though touching 
			the mushroom for confirmation is not recommended).

			<h1>#2 Destroying Angel</h1>

					<p>Destroying Angel</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class = "description">&quot;Your friendly, neighbourhood murderer&quot;</p>		
			<h2>Dangers</h2>
			<p>Judging by its name, you can already tell that the destroying angel isn&rsquo;t exactly a harmless meal. 
			But of course, someone had go and eat it. In fact, this mushroom is responsible for a vast portion of deaths caused
			in mushroom consumption. This is beacuse it is often mistakened for other mushroom types, such as the harmless white
			button, or common meadow mushrooms. At any rate, any consumers will quickly find out that the destroying angel was 
			probably not what they had intended to eat, as symptoms such as delirium, spasms, throwing up, occur within the next 5
			to 24 hours. Not to mention, these symptoms usually fade after a few hours, making the victim think that they are recovering
			when in reality, they are dying on the inside. Nice one, destroying angels. Eventually, the toxins lead to liver and kidney failure, 
			with death quickly following.
			</p>
			<h2>Identification</h2>
			<p>Destroying angels are pure white, hence it&rsquo;s name, &quot;angels&quot;. They have very rounded, egg-shaped caps
			in their early stages, which expand outwards as the mushroom matures, though it still retains much of it&rsquo;s dome structure.
			It has crowded gills and uaually, a curved stem.

			<h1>#1 Death cap</h1>

			<p class = "description">&quot;Apparently it tastes good&quot;</p>		
			<h2>Dangers</h2>
			<p>At long last, the winner of the most murderous and deadly mushroom goes to... the DEATH CAP!!! This is contributed to its qualities
			as an incredibly efficent killer, with a death rate of over 50% in 6 to 12 hours! The secret? Toxins from the death cap literally 
			destroy cells, as it makes it&rsquo;s way to the livers and kidneys, stopping their functions(like the destroying angel). However, 
			the death cap also throws in a bonus of the central nervous system soon after, for extra damage points.</p>
			<p>As if all of this wasn&rsquo;t
			enough, the death cap leads other mushroom species in another battle; globalization. Death caps are mycorrhiza mushrooms, meaning
			they form a mutualistic bond between their host tree, and therefore are attached to its roots. Through the influence of helpful humans,
			who love to bring pretty plants with them as they travel, many death caps happily immigrated along with their hosts from their home continent
			of Europe to settle in North America. Apparently, it&rsquo;s very nice in North America, because the mushrooms quickly established themselves
			in the ecosystem, though scientists aren&rsquo;t yet sure of their influence. In any case, this opportunity to kill people from around the world
			grants them the number one spot on the list of dangerous mushroom species!
			</p>
			<h2>Identification</h2>
			<p>Death caps have a yellow dome cap when young, which opens to a flat white circle with yellow/green tints when matured. Like most other 
			poisonous mushrooms, they also have crowded gills. They are safe to touch, with a somewhat sticky cap, as the toxins are only absorbed through
			injestion. The most defining feature of the death cap, however, is its large white volva.
