			<h2>Cap</h2> 
			<p>This part is pretty straightforward&semi; A cap of a mushroom is essentially it&rsquo;s cap.
			The cap usually resembles a dome and acts like an umbrella to protect the gills. It comes in a variety of 
			colours and patterns.</p>
			<h2>Gills</h2>
			<p>If a mushroom were an apple, the gills would be the apple core. This is the section of mushroom which houses
			and produces the spores.

		<div class = "subject">
			<h2>Ring</h2>
			<p>The ring is the leftover membrane which surrounds the stem after the spores are released. Originally, they would 
			have covered the gills from underneath. However, as the gills develop, the ring is pushed outwards, eventually
			left to linger around the stem. Well, at least it looks somewhat fashonable.</p>	
			<h2>Stem</h2>
			<p>The stem is(obviously) the stem of the mushroom. It is a cylindrical structure that holds up the cap, and 
			connects it to the mycelium. In some mushroom species, the stem is hollow.</p>
			<h2>Volva</h2>
			<p>Similar to the ring, the volva is the remains of a veil which would have covered the mushroom. In this case,
			the membrane formerly protected the mushroom in its premature stages. As the mushroom sprouts, it tears through
			the volva, which is then left circling the bottom of the stem. <p>

			<h2>Mycelium</h2>
			<p>A mushroom&rsquo;s mycelium are basically it&rsquo;s roots. This gathers nutrients from the surface which the 
			mushroom is stationed on, usually decaying trees. The mycelium is located underground, and can expand to form a vast 
			network.</p>	
			<h2>Spore</h2>
			<p>Spores are the seeds of mushrooms, and are nested inside the gills until their release. A single mushroom can contain 
			millions of spores. Since spores are microscopic, they can be carried by air, which they use to travel. </p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Saprophytes</h2> <!-- group name -->
				<!-- description -->
				<p>Saprophytes are organisms which feed off dead and decaying organic matter, such as logs and leaves. In mushrooms, this includes many species which
				are used in medicine and cooking, such as white button, crimini, shiitake and oyster mushrooms.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<p>Parasite mushroom: Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Parasites</h2>			
				<p>Parasites are organisms which steal nutrients from other living organisims, without giving anything to their victim in return. These victims are 
				called hosts. In the case of mushrooms, hosts are often arthropods. One infamous parasitic mushroom known for it&rsquo;s brutal attacks on insects
				is Ophiocordyceps unilateralis.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<p >Mycorrhiza mushroom: Truffle</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Mycorrhiza </h2>			
				<p>Mycorrhiza are creatures which form a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with their host. This means that though they take nutrients from their 
				partner, they also provide other nutrients or benifits in return. These conditions are hard to maintain and harvest, so mycorrrhiza mushrooms
				are only found in nature.</p>
