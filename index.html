				<p>What is a mushroom? Though they are often confused for vegetables, mushrooms are actually more similar to fruits; fruits of a fungus, that is. </p>
				<p>Unlike plants, fungi contain no chlorophyll. This means they do not need sunlight to thrive, but rather, rely on feeding off nutrients from other
				organisms. There are different methods in which this occurs, separating mushrooms into the <a href="mushroom-aboutpage.html#classification">three classes</a> of saprophytes,
				parasites, and mycorrhiza. </p> 
				<p>Since they do not photosynthesize and require a cool and humid environment, mushrooms are fond of the dark. In the wild, this shelter often
				 comes from the shade of trees. Mushrooms are also highly nutritious, and are proven to provide a variety of health benefits, such as being high in potassium.</p>
			</div>
			<p>In other words, if the sun were to ever burn out and therefore killing all plants (and assuming humanity has not yet destroyed itself with a
			nuclear war or climate change), you can always count on mushrooms to save the day!</p>
